### Homework and projects from "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces".

### Projects:
#### unix-utils:
* wcat: `Prints the contents of a given file to the terminal.`
* wgrep: `Prints a line from a given file using a search term`.
* wzip/unzip: `Compresses a file into a binary output stream in 5-byte chunks to be unscrambled into a standard output stream, uses simple RLE (ON HOLD).`
* reverse: `Reverses a file or input (IN PROGRESS).`
* s.u.s.s: `Simple unix-style shell (IN PROGRESS).`

#### Currently working on:
_Project:_ `reverse (simple and easy); s.u.s.s (simple unix-style shell) `
  
_Homework:_ `ch 15`

#### Note:

* The applications are written in such a way that they pass the OSTEP test suite, all removed code is commented (except for wcat).
