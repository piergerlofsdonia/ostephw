#### Emulation of a simple memory allocation system.
##### TODO:
1. Get splitting and coalescing working.
2. Start working on integrating a data structure into this system.
3. Get assignment working (allocating headers and data, initalising the data).
4. Get freeing working (mark as in use, don't tear data down).
5. Write set of tests to ensure this all works correctly.
