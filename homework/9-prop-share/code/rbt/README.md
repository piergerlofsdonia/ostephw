### Lottery scheduler using a red-black tree structure:

#### Notes:

* Hinze's<sup>[1]</sup> paper discusses the problem of constructing a red-black tree using a list of ascending values in linear time. 
* In this paper's introductory pages, the simplest method of constructing a red-black tree is noted: "repeatedly insert elements into an empty initial tree" -  this is a _top down_ approach.

#### Compilation and running:
* Compile and run `lotterysched.c`
* Run `./a.out` and redirect its output to a file, e.g. `./a.out > lottery.txt`
* Whilst the program is running, open and close some processes/applications.
* Check the contents of `lottery.txt`.
