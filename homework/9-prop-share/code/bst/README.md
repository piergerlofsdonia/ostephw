#### Lottery scheduler using a binary-search-tree structure:
* Compile and run `lotterysched.c`
* Run `./a.out` and redirect its output to a file, e.g. `./a.out > lottery.txt`
* Whilst the program is running, open and close some processes/applications.
* Check the contents of `lottery.txt`.

##### TODO:
1. Write tests and check that the array manipulation is working as expected, can do this by reading the pids into a new array and comparing it versus the final array returned to the `main()` block.
